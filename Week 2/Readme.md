<h2> 8th March </h2>
<h4> More questions based on data structures in python </h4>
<ol>
<li> write a python program to calculate the product, multiplying all the nnumbers in a given tuple.
  original tuple: (4,3,2,2,-1,18)
  product - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple: -864
  original tuple : (2,4,8,8,3,2,9)
  prodcut - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple : 27648
</li>

<li> write a python program to calculate the avergae value of the numbres in a given tuple of tuples.
  original tuple = ((10,10,10,12),(30,45,56,45),(81,80,39,32),(1,2,3,4))
  Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples = [30.5,34.25,27.0,23.25]
  original tuple = ((1,1,-5),(30,-15,56),(81,-60,-39),(-10,2,3))
  Average  value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuple = [25.5,-18.0,3.75]
</li>
</ol>
